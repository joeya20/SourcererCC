# Tutorial
SourcererCC is [Sourcerer](http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu/ "Sourcerer Project @ UCI")'s token-based code clone detector for very large code bases and Internet-scale project repositories. SourcererCC works at many levels of granularity such as detecting clones between files, methods, statements or blocks, in any language. This tutorial is for file-level clone detection on Java.

### Additional Resources:

* For more information about SourcererCC please see the [ICSE'16](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06448) paper.
* SourcererCC supports DéjàVu, a large scale study of cloning on GitHub. It has a [homepage](http://mondego.ics.uci.edu/projects/dejavu/), and was published at [OOPSLA'17](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3133908)
* DéjàVu is a supporting web-tool to allow quick and simple clone analysis, can be found [here](http://dejavu.ics.uci.edu/).

### Before going through:

We have created an artifact in the form of a virtual machine (VM) that contains the pre-programmed set of instructions that take the user from raw source code to a database with a clone mapping, including all the intermediate steps and explanation of intermediate data types. It can be downloaded from the 'Source Materials' section of the [paper ACM website](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3133908) or from the [DéjàVu homepage](http://mondego.ics.uci.edu/projects/dejavu/) (only the latter is kept updated).
This VM is the easiest way to get started with SourcererCC to perform your own clone analysis. It has most of the information here. **Please try this VM before contacting us.**

Let's get started.

## Table of Contents
1. Tokenize source code
2. Run SourcererCC
3. I want to know more!

### Tokenize source code:

SourcererCC is a token-based clone detector. This means that source code must go through an initial step of processing. Luckily, we have a tool do to so, which we will explain in this section.

The program needed to tokenize souce code can be found [here](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC/tree/master/tokenizers/file-level). Start by looking at [config.ini](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC/blob/master/tokenizers/file-level/config.ini) which sets the configuration for the tokenizer. You need to edit a few parameters (the parameters not covered here can be dismissed for now):

Performance parameters:
```
N_PROCESSES = 1
; How many projects does each process process at a time?
PROJECTS_BATCH = 2
``` 

Where `N_PROCESSES` are active at any given time, and each one processes a batch of `PROJECTS_BATCH` projects.

To set the input you can do:
```
FILE_projects_list = this/is/a/path/paths.txt
```
where `paths.txt` is a list of project paths, the projects we want to find clones on. A sample of a `paths.txt` file would look like this:

```
path/for/projects/aesthetic-master.zip
path/for/projects/aesthetic-master.zipOffsetAnimator-master.zip
path/for/projects/aesthetic-master.zipResourceInspector-master.zip
path/for/projects/aesthetic-master.zipzachtaylor-JPokemon.zip
```

Language configurations. Since comments are removed you need to set the language primitives for `comment_inline` and `comment_open_tag`/`comment_close_tag` comments. Finally, describe the `File_extensions` being analyzed (supports a list of extensions):
```
[Language]
comment_inline = //
comment_open_tag = /*
comment_close_tag = */
File_extensions = .py
```
And then run with:
```
python tokenizer.py zip
```
where `zip` is the extension of the individual projects in `FILE_projects_list = this/is/a/path/paths.txt`. 

The resulting output is composed of three folders, in the same location:
* `bookkeeping_projs/` - contains a list of processed projects. Has the following format:
`project id, project path, project url`
* `files_stats/` - contains lists of files together with various statistics. Has the following format:
`file id,project id,project path,project url,file hash,size bytes,lines,LOC,SLOC`
* `files_tokens/` - contains lists of files together with various statistics and the tokenized forms. Has the following format: `file id,project id,total tokens,unique tokens,token hash@#@token1@@::@@frequency,token2@@::@@frequency,...`

The elements `file id` and `project id` always point to the same source code file or project, respectively (they work as a primary key). So a line in `files_stats/*` that start with `1,1` represents the same file as the line in `files_tokens/*` that starts with `1,1`, and these came from the project in `bookkeeping_projs/*` whose line starts with `1`.
The number of lines in `bookkeeping_projs/*` corresponds to the total number of projects analyzed, the number of lines in `files_stats/*` is the same as `files_tokens/*` and is the same as the total number of files obtained from the projects.

### Run SourcererCC

For this step we will run SourcererCC, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC/tree/master/clone-detector).


Start with `files_tokens/` from the previous step:

```
cat files_tokens/* > blocks.file
cp blocks.file SourcererCC/clone-detector/input/dataset/
```

Inside [clone-detector/](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC/tree/master/clone-detector) it is worth looking at [sourcerer-cc.properties](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC/blob/master/clone-detector/sourcerer-cc.properties), in particular at:

```
# Ignore all files outside these bounds
MIN_TOKENS=65
MAX_TOKENS=500000
```
where you can set an upper and lower bound for file clone detection. You can dismiss the other parameters for now.

To change the percentage of clone similarity, look at [runnodes.sh](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC/blob/master/clone-detector/runnodes.sh#L9), line 9:

```
threshold="${3:-8}"
```
where `8` means clones will be flagged at 80% similarity (current setup), `7` at 70%, and so on.
The JVM parameters can be configured in the [same file](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC/blob/master/clone-detector/runnodes.sh#L20), at line 20.

Finally, run:

```
python controller.py
```
This tool splits the task by multiple nodes, which must be aggregated in the end:

```
cat clone-detector/NODE_*/output8.0/query_* > results.pairs
```

The resulting information is a list of file id pairs which are clones. These ids correspond to the ids
generated in the tokenization phase. An example output is:

```
1,2
2,3
```

In this case we have the clone pairs `(1,2)` and `(2,3)`. To know which file corresponds to `1`, we can look at the folder `files_stats/*` and look for the line with the unique id `1`.

### I want to know more!

That is great :+1: In the VM we refer to above you can find instructions and programs to import everything into an easily queryable database and perform statistic analysis on this information.
Our [OOPSLA'17](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3133908) paper is a great way to understand out typical pipeline and which kind of results you can obtain.
